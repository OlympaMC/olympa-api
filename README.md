# OlympaAPI

Olympa was a multi-game Minecraft server. To add content to the Minecraft game, we used an API called Spigot that allows us to interact with the Minecraft environment.The server is now closed and this is one of the archives of these many plugins. This repo is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

Internal API that contains the minimum for the project developers to interact with the environment. OlympaAPI needs OlympaCore to work properly in production.
The OlympaAPI JAR is used for experimental testing purposes locally.
